          </div>
          <p>I've worked at Amalfi's italian resturaunt for the past seven years. I started as a bright eyed 19 year old freshly graduated out of high school. I started out doing dishes, worked my way into the kitechen, moved over to bussing and started serving tables a few years ago. I have become more of a people person than i would have ever imagined.</p>
          <p>however, after seven years, I've decided its time for a change of scenery. a Friend of mine recently graduated from <em>Epicodus</em> and recommended their intro to programming course to me. I tried out the first few open coursework lessons on their website and was hooked! In the first few weeks i have learned so much, that my first few projects I've made compared to where I am now feels like worlds apart!</p>

          <p>Ever since I was a young boy I have been muscially Inclined. I can remember mashing keys on my parents keyboard when i was probably 3 or so. I played french horn in middle school all the way through high school, and picked up guitar my senior year of high school. There isnt a single day that goes by where im not practicing on my guitar or singing along to something on the radio</p>
