          <h2>About my professional life and how I got here</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I've worked at Amalfi's italian resturaunt for the past seven years. I started as a bright eyed 19 year old freshly graduated out of high school. I started out doing dishes, worked my way into the kitechen, moved over to bussing and started serving tables a few years ago. I have become more of a people person than i would have ever imagined.</p>
        <p>however, after seven years i've decided its time for a change of scenery. a Friend of mine recently graduated from Epicodus and recommended their intro to programming course to me. I tried out the first few open coursework lessons on their website and was hooked!</p>
