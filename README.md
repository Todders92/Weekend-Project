## Description

_This directory showcases what I have learned using HTML, CSS, GitHub, and Bootstrap. The directory, when opened using a web browser, tells a little bit about myself and links some of the things I have programmed._

## Setup/Instalation Requirements

* _Clone this repository off GitHub_
* _open index.html in web browser(Chrome, Firefox, etc.)_
* _Enjoy_

_code is all self contained and pretty straightforward, if wanting to showcase index.html as a standalone, make sure to grab the css directory and img directory otherwise none of the pictures or css elements will load on the webpage._

## Known Bugs

_None yet! Give it time, I'm sure I'll run into something._

## technologies Used
